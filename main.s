; This is intended as an introductory example to NES programming with ca65.
; It covers the basic use of background, sprites, and the controller.
; This does not demonstrate how to use sound.
;
; This is not intended as a ready-made game. It is only a very minimal
; playground to assist getting started in NES programming. The idea here is
; to get you past the most difficult parts of a minimal NES program setup
; so that you can experiment from an almost blank slate.
;
; To use your own graphics, replace the two 4k tile banks provided.
; They are named "background.chr" and "sprite.chr".
;
; The reset and nmi routines are provided as a simple working example of
; these things. Writing these from scratch is a more advanced topic, so they
; will not be fully explained here.
;
; Under "drawing utilities" are some very primitive routines for working
; with the NES graphics. See the "main" section for examples of how to use them.
;
; Finally at the bottom you will find the "main" section that provides
; a small example program. A cursor is shown. Pressing the d-pad will move
;   - pressing the d-pad will move the cursor around the screen
;   - pressing B will draw a tile to the screen
;   - pressing A will draw several tiles to the screen
;   - pressing SELECT will reset the background
;   - holding START will demonstrate scrolling
;
; Please note that this example code is intended to be simple, not necessarily
; efficient. I have tried to avoid optimization in favour of easier to understand code.
;
; You may notice some odd behaviour when using the A button around the edges of the screen.
; I will leave it as an exercise for the curious to understand what is going on.
